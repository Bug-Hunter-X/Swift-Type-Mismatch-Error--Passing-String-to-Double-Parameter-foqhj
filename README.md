# Swift Type Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift programming: passing an incorrect data type as an argument to a function.  The example focuses on passing a String where a Double is expected.  This can lead to compilation errors or unexpected runtime behavior if not caught early.

The `bug.swift` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.swift` file provides the corrected version.

## How to reproduce:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.swift` in Xcode.
3. Attempt to compile the code.  You will encounter a compiler error highlighting the type mismatch.
